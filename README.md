Here-in slides for a talk I did at a [Vancouver Node.js
Meetup](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/nodejs-meetup-vancouver-tickets-12337546935)
Thu, 7 Aug 2014.

Open index.html in your browser to walk through it or visit the latest
published version at <http://trentm.com/talk-bunyan-in-prod/>.

There is a [PDF](https://github.com/trentm/talk-bunyan-in-prod/blob/master/bunyan-in-prod.pdf)
that should be mostly up to date.

This presentation uses [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/).
